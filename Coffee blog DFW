		  <p style="text-align: left;">This is a site featuring some of my favorite spots
		  in the DFW metroplex to grab coffee. To me, coffee is much
		  more than a beverage. Coffee is an experience that cultivates
		  community and provides a warmth that invites you to the third
		  place. Sitting in your local coffee shop should relax, inspire,
		  and reconstitute you in whatever you may have going on in 
		  your busy life.<br> 
		  <br><strong>My Hope is that this list provides you
		  with many of those experiences through out the metroplex.</strong>

			   <p>George coffee is known across the metroplex
			   as the perfect spot for the best photoshoots. It's
			   clean and crisp exterior welcomes you into a space
			   that feels more like a cool kids table scaled up into
			   a coffee shop than anything else. The interior is just
			   as pituresque and even homier. It also has this 
			   weird tardis effect, seeming way bigger on the inside.

			<li><h3>Edison Coffee Co</h3></li>
			<img src="edison pic.jpg" width="400" height="200" style="align:left"></a> 
			<p>Edison Coffe Co is somewhere very special to me. It was the
			first coffee shop I discovered that was not a starbucks. I was
			in Highschool at the time, and I did not even see the point
			of doing coffe anywhere other than the well established chain. 
			Boy was I wrong. My first drink there was a mocha, and I had no idea 
			espresso could taste so good. Needless to say I was hooked. Over the 
			years, Edison has changed locations several times and each time, it got
			prettier and prettier until they finally built onf of the most asthetic 
			interiors I have ever been in. Edison will always be where I discovered my
			love for coffee, It will always be where I proposed to my wife, and 
			it will always create that atmosphere of the "third place". If i were 
			to pick an all time favorite, this would certainly be it.
